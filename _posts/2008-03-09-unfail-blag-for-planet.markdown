Planet Compiz Fusion no longer displays the last image used in this post in the title name anymore. I did some poking around and realized the normal RSS feed had gone bad, so iXce and I found the atom feed and are now using that (I couldn't find it at first!). If your shiny RSS reader is displaying random image names instead of actual post names from my blag, please update your feeds and add this one:

Just one of the many reasons to host a blag these days. Of couse, I really [can't be bothered to pay for hosting](http://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/default.asp?location=www.google.com.au%2Fsearch), [handle the digg effect](http://www.ndesign-studio.com/blog/updates/the-digg-effect/comment-page-3/), and fight [spam](http://youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE) as it floods in. Oh well :)
