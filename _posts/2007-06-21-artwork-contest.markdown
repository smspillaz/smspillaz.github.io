From Patrick (Marex_v2) :

Hi,

As you might know the Compiz Community Project (CompComm) is now known as "Compiz Fusion".
What we need now is a logo and branding. And that's where you take place.

Create a logo for the Compiz Fusion project and post your suggestions here.
After one week[two weeks] we will choose the best suggestion and use it as our logo.

Additional it would be nice if the new logo would include the compiz logo (link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Compiz_logo.svg) in some way, but that is not a requirement and should only give you an idea what would be possible.

Also feel free to post some feedback, ideas and thoughts here.

Have fun,
