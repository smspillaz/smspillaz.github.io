For those of you who want to check out the extension system of elements-extendible, here are some extension plugins for you to try.

[Bouncing Balls A.K.A Boing](http://smspillaz.googlepages.com/boing.tar.gz)

[Roaches](http://smspillaz.googlepages.com/roach.tar.gz)

Both plugins were made by mdot earlier this year and make use of the texture animation system I recently implemented. In order to use this, create multiple copies of the 'element' in the multi-list with different textures and set them all with the same 'Element Iter.'
