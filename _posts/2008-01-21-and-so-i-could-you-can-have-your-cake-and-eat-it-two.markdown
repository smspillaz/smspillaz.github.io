Dear[ interblag and blagotubes](http://xkcd.com/181/).

As you may already know, I'm working on an[ interface for the Wii Remote and Compiz](http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showthread.php?t=6395&page=5) via [LibCWiiD](http://www.wiili.org/index.php/Main_Page).

Anyways, I was working towards integrating support for multiple Wiimotes, but was a little discouraged once I found this


<blockquote>For your todo/roadmap, I would move support for multiple wiimotes and attachments a bit higher up the list</blockquote>


Anyways, regardless of that, I seem to have got it working the way I wanted it to, because I now have **two** callbacks showing information forÂ  _each separate wiimote._ Output below!


<blockquote>First Wii Remote Callback:
totals are 816.000000, 830.000000, ircount is 0
first ir y is 600, second is 291
Second Wii Remote Callback:
totals are 962.000000, 581.000000, ircount is 0
first ir y is 604, second is 297
First Wii Remote Callback:
totals are 797.000000, 841.000000, ircount is 0
first ir y is 604, second is 297
Second Wii Remote Callback:
totals are 977.000000, 588.000000, ircount is 0
first ir y is 611, second is 300</blockquote>


So what does this mean to folks who have Wiimotes but don't really care about the code side of things? Well, it means that You'll be able to do Head-Tracking (Via WiiTrack) AND have mouse control and gesture support. How neat is that?
