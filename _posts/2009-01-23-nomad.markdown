Yes, this is one of those words tossed around by the developers a lot which symbolizes [one](http://gitweb.compiz-fusion.org/?p=compiz;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/nomad-0.7.8) of the [many](http://gitweb.compiz-fusion.org/?p=compiz;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/object-framework) [rewrites](http://gitweb.compiz-fusion.org/?p=compiz;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/compiz%2B%2B) of compiz core due to a lack of any decent organizational structure.

After our last developer meeting, we were all given the challenge of at least _trying_ NOMAD if we had both the hardware an the time to do so. I have two laptops that can run compiz and my school holidays. *cough*

(Sorry gnash users, I'll upload the OGG somewhere when I get time)

**Edit:** There was a section in the video about forwarding other desktop channels like sound etc. I personally did not get them to work (X, DnD, session re-attachination) but Jigish and others have told me that it works for them.
