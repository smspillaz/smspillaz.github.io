We are pretty close to a 0.9 Beta now in terms of functionality. Most of the plugins have been ported in some form to compiz++ although some (mostly the one's I've done) are broken in some way which makes them unusable. When I say 'most', I mean that it is about 80% feature parity with 0.8, just some of the *big* plugins have not been ported yet. Asides from some of my own plugins and other users, most user plugins (especially big ones) still need to be ported. Additionally, we still have the following on our list:

**Core:**



	
  * Desktop Cube (which I believe rcxdude is working on, but I have yet to get ahold of him)

	
  * Rotate Cube

	
  * DBUS

	
  * Video


**Main:**



	
  * Colorfilter

	
  * EZoom (which I am working on right now)

	
  * Group (This one is a bit of a hotcake)

	
  * Ring

	
  * Shift

	
  * Session

	
  * Workarounds


**Extra:**



	
  * Bicubic filtering

	
  * Stackswitch

	
  * Firepaint

	
  * Showmouse

	
  * Animation Addons


Pretty much everything else is almost done or has bugs unless specified above.

Special thanks also to Erkin Bahceci [cornelius], Joel Bosveld [b0le], Dennis Kasprzyk [onestone] and Danny Baumann [maniac] for continuing to work on the project despite their lack of time due to other commitments.

Also, huge thanks to our userbase for not exploding / forking the project [1] / getting impatient over the long period of experimental development. While it has been a bit slower than we previously aimed, we are almost there and couldn't do so without the continued knowledge that we have a faithful and understanding userbase which makes our contribution so worthwhile.

Other developers will be posting what they have been working on within the next few days. As we get closer to the beta, I'll be going over some of the fundamental differences and changes for the better in compiz-0.9 compared to compiz. It will begin at the developer level and slowly go to the user level. Most of the changes here are for development but are there for the long term and as such I believe that they will affect users and the entire freedesktop community in the long term as well.

As soon as the 0.9.x release cycle starts rolling ahead and I finish high school, I will be writing community news blog posts again as part of our strategy to really push compiz-0.9/1.0.

[1] I don't consider that 'Beryl back from the ashes' packaging of Beryl for Intrepid a fork. That was just plain stupid.
