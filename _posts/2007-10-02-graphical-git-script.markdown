Well, as some of you may know, I have started work on a GUI Git script written in my oh-so-holy language python (ducks from flying tomatoes). Anyways, it was designed for three reasons



	
  * I had to kill some time

	
  * Some people (Like I used to be) do not like typing out big long things in terminals or doing things again and again repetitively

	
  * I've noticed that Compiz Fusion has attracted a whole bunch of Windows XP and Vista users to the Linux destkop, which is great, but they are used to "Next" installers and are probably not tolerant or familiar with Synaptic, Yum, YAST, and other command line tools to install Compiz.


Now you are probably asking why I decided to make this a 'git-getter' script instead of a script that gets packages or release tarballs is because

	
  * Release tarballs are old, git is fairly stable most of the time (Maybe I will add a thing to read from status to see if it is worth updating) and if people are going to be using to the tool to update compiz, they are probably going to expect an update at LEAST once a week / two week.

	
  * I can't be bothered to integrate with every package manager out there Oo.


A lot of people also begged me to have the default install path to be ~. But I decided to just use the compiz defaults and let the user specify the path if necessary.

Also a quote from Vicky Pollard (Little Britain BBC3) :


<blockquote>"Shut up *squint* I ain't done .... not ... ing and *squint* if you sai I do, you all get *squint* beatons"</blockquote>


Heh. Jokes aside, here are some screenshots.

PS. Yes, I am working on a simple configurator, but it hit a roadblock when I left sailing for a week

PS 2, Maybe I will talk about the sailing later - it was fun :)

PS 3, Blog will be up tommorow or the day after, lots of stuff happened while I was away

PS 4, I've never had so many PS's in a blog before :)
