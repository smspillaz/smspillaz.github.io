Hi,

Over the past few years, I have promised a new direction for the compiz project. I promised that with the new backing we'd see a revival in development, and increased stability.

I have failed.

I have failed the compiz community.

I have failed the Ubuntu community.

I have failed the previous maintainers.

Despite my best efforts, stability has gotten worse, and I feel as though I can't even get the simplest things right for the project anymore.

Perhaps things will get better, perhaps things will get worse. I would only hope that the project can attract some of the people it needs in order to keep it alive as it once was, or can solidify on a new direction.
