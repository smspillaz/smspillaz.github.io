... to take a break from blogging and writing wiki articles for a while and try doing some development instead. I've been toying around with Python recently (First programming experience... w00t!) and tried out some of the [PyGTK tutorials](http://pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/) and after looking around for something to be done, I decided it was about time we got a settings tool for the other decorators that come with Compiz! Currently, I've only got settings for gtk-window-decorator, emerald, shadows and global stuff - I have yet to find out how to manipulate kde-window-decorator settings. Also, currently, only the GUI is done. The actual modification of the GConf variables will be very tricky indeed! If anyone can give me a demonstration on how to do that I will be very grateful. Anyways, here are a few screenshots. Note that it isn't complete and I intend to change some stuff.

Note that this is my first actual PyGTK program and it would probably look bad for those who are experienced at PyGTK. Ironically, CCSM is also based on PyGTK, so I had a look at it and got a lot of helpful advice ;-)

Don't worry if you miss the blog! It will be up next week. News has been a little slow lately ;-)
