I've been getting a bit of [**impostor syndrome**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) lately, something which I feel is holding me back a fair bit. Not sure what it is, but it seems like every time I try to move on a moment of inspiration, I start to second-guess. Is what I'm doing a useful endeavor? Maybe someone else has already done this? Am I good enough to write this yet?

Of course, its terribly annoying - I've been left with a bunch of half-finished projects for a [**broader initiative**](http://www.polysquare.org), which seems to create a nasty feedback loop confirming the sense of unworthiness.

Perhaps this is the wrong place to ask this - but does anybody have a good idea on how to make these thoughts go away? I'd much rather be presenting cool things in this space than saying that I've talked myself out of yet another idea.
