Hmm, Just a thought.

I was using Vista to copy some files toÂ  my portable HDD so I could get them on my Mac. It took about 10 min to copy the files which were of a hefty size (About 500 mb). They were video files too. Now, to copy them to my mac, it took 1 min to copy them and about 6 to convert them into something iMovie could understand. Hmm, this tells me something

(OK, I admit it. The Mac is newer hardware. (Core 2 Duo) Vista is (2.0GHz Pentium 4) Still, something on the vista computer was chewing up CPU cycles. Something called [svchost.exe](http://ask-leo.com/svchost_and_svchostexe_crashs_cpu_maximization_viruses_exploits_and_more.html) and dwm.exe )
