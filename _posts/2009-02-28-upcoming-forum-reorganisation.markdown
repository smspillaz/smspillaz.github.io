If you haven't seen the announcement on the forum already, you should probably be aware that the support and web teams will be carrying out a forum rework on March 2nd 0200 GMT. The main reasons for this were the fact that current forum structure doesn't fit well with our user base and doesn't promote much community involvement. With the new forum structure, we hope this will change.

There will be a bit of weirdness as we move stuff around, so I wouldn't advise posting for a few hours around that time (most of our users will be asleep [or should be!] anyways, so this shouldn't be too much of a problem).

Also, if something is not working or things are in the wrong place, feel free to report that thread to the moderators. I usually act upon reports from the forum on-the-day.

The announcement can be found [here](http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/announcement.php?f=88&a=12)

**Update: **_It's been delayed a bit because of some things we had to work out. The forum is in read-only mode for the moment and will be ready in a day or two. Stay tuned!_

**Update 2: **_Work has started. Please hold._

**Update 3:** _It's done! See the announcement for details and over the next few days, don't post unless you absolutely need to as there is a slight chance we may have to revert to previous backups and we'll lose your posts!_
