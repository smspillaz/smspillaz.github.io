The obvious solution to resolve the [differences](http://smspillaz.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/the-actual-mir-and-wayland-comparison/) between Mir and Wayland/Weston was to [merge the two](http://smspillaz.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/the-actual-mir-and-wayland-comparison/#comment-8418):

Now you can get [WayMir](https://github.com/smspillaz/waymir) bang for your buck.

As usual, with most software released by me on a last-minute schedule, there is probably some minor syntax error which causes it not to build. Or merge conflict markers in this case.
