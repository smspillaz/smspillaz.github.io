Dear Interwobs

Can someone give me a pre-compiled for SUSE 10.3 version of the [X Server with DRI2](http://hoegsberg.blogspot.com/2008/03/i-just-committed-last-bit-of-dri2-work.html). [My laptop overheats the minute I try to compile anything :/](http://help.lockergnome.com/linux/Acer-Aspire-3003NLMi-overheating-ftopict282493.html)
