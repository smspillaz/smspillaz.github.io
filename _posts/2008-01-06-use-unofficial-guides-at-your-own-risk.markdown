Recently, a lot of problems have been caused for Ubuntu users by using [this guide](http://phorolinux.com/how-to-install-compiz-fusion-060-from-sources-on-ubuntu-710-gutsy-gibbon.html).

Do yourself a favor. Don't use it. It features 3 main problems



	
  * It installs to /usr, overwriting previous Compiz Fusion default installations

	
  * It really just goes to the effort of installing the version of compiz already installed from source - something completely necessary.

	
  * It will break** all **configuration applications because it launches Compiz with the gconf backend and not the ccp backend.


It goes without saying, if you want to install Compiz Fusion, please use an [official guide.](http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/Distributions)

Thankyou
