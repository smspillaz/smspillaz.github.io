**Compiz 0.9.2 Released!**

I have just pushed* the tarballs for the 0.9.2 [release](http://lists.compiz.org/pipermail/community/2010-October/000253.html) of compiz. This release represents an evolution upon the development series, with plenty of bugs fixed (including a few major ones in the least release), and a few new features, including:



	
  * New **MultiAnim** class which allows for mutliple copies of windows in animations

	
  * **Minimized live window previews** (experimental)

	
  * **Re-written group plugin**

	
  * **Natural** scale mode

	
  * **Simplified** shadow storage in the decorators


**Coming up in 0.9.4:**



	
  * Support for Mutli-Touch and Multi-Input (via MPX and UTouch)

	
  * Animations framework, allowing for plugins to simply create animations and use existing ones provided by other plugins

	
  * Compiling plugins into core for **massive speedups**


_Stay tuned for more info_

**edit:** there are a few last minute bugs which made it into this release - a 0.9.2.1 is coming soon.
