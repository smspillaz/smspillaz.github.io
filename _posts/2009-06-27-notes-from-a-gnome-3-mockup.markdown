Accuse me of blogspam and whatnot, but I saw this, it was really cool and I thought I just /had/ to share it with you.

Yes, I'm talking about [that UI mockup on the front page of reddit today](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsZvwyxJ9vk). Some of the stuff I saw there just made me think "Why isn't some of the stuff there already in compiz today?".

Granted, most of the effects show in the video are already in compiz (such as wobbly, dodge, etc) but it was the 2 at the end that got me. The first is where the user drags the window onto the taskbar and it minimizes. Makes. So. Much. Damn. Sense. _Why_ have I been wasting so much time trying to reach for a little button on the window decoration when all that time I could have just used fitts law as we already do with the launcher menu, hotcorners etc to minimize windows. _Why_? The same concept is (rather neatly) applied to the workspace switcher as well.

This could all work out in the panel interface I've been thinking of but not really acting on at the moment. Sigh - internets, plz give me some developers to help me with this. kthx.
