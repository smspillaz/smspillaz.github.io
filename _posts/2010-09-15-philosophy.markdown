So we got featured on hypeville AKA "OhMyDeityUbuntu!".

Seems like a lot of discussion in the comments about the expansion of compiz into "useless bloat" and the fact that it has too many options.

Let me be very clear. Compiz' philosophy is to be infinitely extensible. We are a plugin-based window manager and we are proud of it. You can change compiz to suit however you like, from bling-bling to subtly simple. It's up to you.

I won't ever remove options for the sake of trying to determine for users what is "sane" and what is "not sane". This is, quite frankly, against what I stand for.

If you someone to decide what is a "sane" configuration for you, turn to your distribution packager or desktop team to figure it out for you.
