I was having a discussion with[ marnanel](http://blogs.gnome.org/metacity/)Â yesterday about bugs. He then asked me some questions:

    
    21:43 <marnanel> c) do you
                     actually ever sleep? :)


To which I replied

    
    c) no

Then I'm thinking, uhhh, that's actually a thing?
