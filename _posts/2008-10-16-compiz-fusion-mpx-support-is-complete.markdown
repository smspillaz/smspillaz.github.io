I have now completed the first draft of the patches to add MPX support to Compiz-Fusion. These are only the first draft patches, so there are still tons of bugs to be fixed. After I fix those bugs, I'll begin work on the Input Redirection patches for the rest of Compiz-Fusion. Below is a video of all the work done so far with IR/MPX:

The patches will be released on November 1's, 2008.
