If you happened to be reading planet.compiz.org, you may have noticed my blog post was randomly interjected by a whole bunch of legal jargon about something completely unrelated.

Anyways, I guess what must have happened is that I was working with a bunch of text from a criminal law assignment I was doing earlier that day must have crept it's way into my blog editor by means of copy and paste.

Anyways, the planet feed should probably rectify itself soon soon, but I have included a screenshot in case you were wondering what it looks like.
