As someone who has experience with both codebases, I feel qualified to answer this question.

**Mir:** More focus on unit testing, less experience with the linux graphics stack.

**Wayland/Weston:** Less focus on unit testing, more experience with the linux graphics stack.

Done. Can we move on to something else now?
