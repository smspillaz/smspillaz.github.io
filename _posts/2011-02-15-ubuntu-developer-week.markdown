On the 1st of March at 16:00 UTC, I will be giving a session at [Ubuntu Developer Week](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek) on how to write a Compiz Plugin and get started with Compiz development in general. I am just finishing my draft of the lesson I will be giving, but we will be covering topics such as:



	
  * Setting up the development environment to write, build and test Compiz plugins

	
  * Basic plugin set-up and tear down - getting your plugin to build and load

	
  * Handling events

	
  * Drawing to the screen and Drawing to windows

	
  * Reading and using options


If you've ever wanted to get started with Compiz plugin development, then now is a really great chance to get a head start to learn how things work. I can't wait to see you all down there! (And see what you can come up with!)
