Recently, I attended a funeral of a boy who goes to my school and was tragically killed in a motorbike accident after school finished.

Rest in Peace Lockie. You were such a broad-lived soul who was always willing to give everything a go. You performed with me in various drama productions and were an enthusiastic and efficient sailing partner.

If there is something after this for you, I hope you are rewarded for your efforts.
