Just a few things that marex forgot to mention :

1 : The logo's are _not_ final, and the web team will work with the artist to tweak the logo for the needs of web design and composition.

2 : Logo's for decorators / Settings Managers will be used if provided, if not, they will be based on the official Compiz-Fusion logo
