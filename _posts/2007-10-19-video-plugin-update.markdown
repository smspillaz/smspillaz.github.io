I've noticed in the comments that a lot of people are having trouble with a blue / white tinge on video when using the mPlayer patch.

If you are not using a patched up Xgl (Allowing RBG -> YV12 colorspace conversion), try enabling / disabling 'Use YV12 Colorspace' on the video plugin

Make sure the video plugin is loaded too :)
