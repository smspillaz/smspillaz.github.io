**Bits and pieces:**



	
  * I'm on final year-end university entrance exams so I'm pretty quiet in all facets of life these days

	
  * We are still doing maintenance 0.8 releases and the next release will have some fixes for some rather annoying bugs:

	
    * Not crashing when there is no mipmapping extension when mipmap blur is on (very rare case)

	
    * Wobbly and resize obey the constrain_y option in move (so windows can't be resized or 'thrown' offscreen where they cannot be dragged by titlebar)

	
    * Getting the largest possible icon from libwnck for Shift, Ring, Switcher, Staticswitcher [this fixes blurry looking icons in /some/ cases]

	
    * Fixed some crashes on 64-bit arch due to 0 != NULL




	
  * Still waiting on cube from rcxdude - I sent him a mail about it, last I heard it is almost done but he tends to drift away from compiz at places

	
  * 0.9 release is still coming, hopefully by the end of this year.

	
  * I finish exams in the middle of November, so hopefully things should move a little faster then.
