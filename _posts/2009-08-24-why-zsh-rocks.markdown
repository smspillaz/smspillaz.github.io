I think the following makes this a post about why $SHELL is better than $OTHERSHELL

    
    zsh: sure you want to delete all the files in /home/smspillaz/Source/compiz/dev/plugins/mblur/build [yn]?


I can't think of the number of times that has saved me from doing something stupid at 3AM.

Also, there's the prompt
![Screenshot-Terminal](http://smspillaz.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/screenshot-terminal.png)With the built-in autocompletion.

The bar down the bottom is the awesomeness that is screen coupled with [byobu](https://launchpad.net/byobu).

So there is the case. My zshrc can be found [here](http://smspillaz.googlepages.com/zshrc). Credit to who-t for the git-branch display code, the shell is the well-known 'petes-shell' the synergy related stuff is from synergy+ and the kde functions are from the kde project to simplify building kde.

And on the compiz front:
 * Ported showmouse, firepaint, ezoom and mblur (although showmouse is broken :<). I am currently working on DBUS but it's quite a load because the plugin is so huge and depended on quite a lot of the old interfaces in 0.8

[BTW, if you saw my rant on reddit about BoycottNovell - I was perfectly serious about it. BN, don't link to this post or else you **will** see mono bindings to compiz].
