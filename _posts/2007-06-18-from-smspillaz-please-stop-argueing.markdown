Do people know how to read the TITLE of a thread! Look CAREFULLY! Its ALL IN CAPS! THERE TO BE SEEN! FIRST  THING THERE! IN SIZE 72 FONT! CAN YOU SEE IT NOW??!?!? IT SAYS :


# PLEASE READ AND DISCUSS CONSTRUCTIVELY!!!!!


Construcively does not mean :


<blockquote>_'We should argue endlessly_  _until one of us gives up instead of getting things done.'_</blockquote>


I am really sick and tired of the fact that I am hyping everyone up for something that isn't coming.

/rant

On a side note, the blog will be delayed *further* as the server that hosts the forums and gitweb is down.

Move right along and hope you took something away from this. Thanks.
