User **spiorf** has just reported to me that the NVIDIA Black Window Bug - where new windows would open as black as Video Ram was exhausted has finally been fixed in the[ NVIDIA Driver 100.14.19.](http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_100.14.19.html)

**spiorf** reported that his system had 1GB of RAM, 128 MB of VRAM and that he used to face the bug with about 10-20 windows open. He posted a [screenshot  ](http://spiorf.homeip.net/uploads/bwbgone.png)of his desktop with 40 windows open and blur enabled. He also reported that the Black VT swictch bug is gone too!

This is a great day for Compiz NVIDIA users. A great day

UPDATE : I was just told that the Black VT bug came along after the 3 time the VT was switched. That's too bad I guess. Although it is probably now safe to use Compiz with Direct Rendering
