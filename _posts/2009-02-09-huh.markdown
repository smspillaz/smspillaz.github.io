If you updated compiz today from git (like any awesome person would), you probably would have noticed the following error:

    
    User@XPS-SUSE:~/Source/Compiz-Fusion/personal/compiz> git pull origin master
    fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
    User@XPS-SUSE:~/Source/Compiz-Fusion/personal/compiz>


It's actually

    
    git clone git://git.compiz-fusion.org/compiz/core *
    git checkout -b  origin/compiz-0.8 --track




##### *Tentatively


Stay tuned for updates.
