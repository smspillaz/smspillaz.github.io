Finally got my XPS m1530. It was freed from vice-ta as iXce called it within 30 minutes. Runs compiz like a dream, A little hint would be to turn of anti-aliasing in nvidia-settings and turn on blur so that the built-in 8600GT clocks up to it's best speed. You won't believe the next screenshot:

I have yet to see any choppyness when I've got rain, blur, motion blur, tons of windows open, transparent cube & 3D, cube deformations and 3 videos and 4 **redirected** (beat that OasisGames) GL apps running.

Only problems I've run into so far with this laptop is the expresscard slot not being recognised, so I can't watch TV, the internal mic not working, eject touch-button being locked and the fact that it is missing from the sleep whitelist, so it can't sleep yet (it can hibernate though!)

Also, it runs at a nice and cool 40C when compiling software, so I wont have overheating wasting my time anymore (Juts a lot more drooling and gaming!)

Overall, I'd certainly recommend this laptop to linux users - runs like a dream!
