## Patches are almost finished


So I've finished what I wanted to achieve with input redirection and the X patches, now I just need to do a little bugfixing and hole-filling. The only things I haven't got around to doing are expo and wiitrack, mainly because they were too complicated for me to implement in the current system.

Here are a list of changes that come with IR:



	
  * Interact with transformed freewins windows

	
  * Use all windows at once during scale / shift/ ring mode

	
  * Interact with shelfed windows

	
  * Proper input redirection in ezoom (no more cursor scaling / hiding)


And, as always, a screencast:
