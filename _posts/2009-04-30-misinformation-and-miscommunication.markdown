A while back I said a few (looking back on it, rather harsh) [words](http://smspillaz.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/compiz-09x-where-are-we-now-and-where-to-from-here/) about gnome-shell. I've probably miscommunicated what I was trying to say with regards to that situation.

First of all, such comments are (roughly) my own opinion and my stance has changed to be a bit more neutral since then - of course with the status quo and the way GNOME-Shell is written, it would be difficult to make it WM-agnostic as it is now. Looking at the code the job may be a little harder than I thought. Of course, it's important to note that though I am a member of the compiz council (an ill fitted one at times), usually my comments don't represent the entire view of the compiz project (even though it might look like it).

Secondly, I get the impression that people are starting to think GNOME is some kind of evil project. They're really not - and I think GNOME-Shell has a lot of merit to it and is certainly a step in the right direction for bringing a composited desktop to the masses.

The only concerns that I had outlined with it was that it integrated the panel with the window manager. This has it's merits and can make things a lot easier, but also means that if you were to start another window manager (i.e compiz) you would lose your panel. There are replacements for the panel (like AWN, Kiba) but for people who like the normal panel (like me), this isn't the best scenario.

I guess the best thing to do now is to let matters cool down and cross the bridge of the issue of the panel when we get to it.

So please - don't turn this into some kind of holy war, because it really isn't. I always try to live by the rule 'Assume best intentions' i.e people aren't evil for the sake of being evil - there is always some good intent in actions. The shell issue will sort it self out, it's just one of the many little things that should probably be addressed in the future.
