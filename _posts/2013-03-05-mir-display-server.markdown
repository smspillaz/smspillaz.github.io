CongratulationsÂ to Canonical on the release of the Mir Display Server. Mir will be an important step for them in delivering the converged Ubuntu product and I wish them all the best.

It isn't something I'll be able to work on in the future though. I'm trying my best to focus on my studies for now, and I don't want to get sucked into it.
