Hi guys

So I've been working on Fusion-Installer a little more and it is getting better. I've implemented a nice treeview for you to pick components and you can now resize the window (Yes, I've kicked my gtkFixed habits :D)

Sorry about the interpolation.

FusionInstaller isn't quite ready yet - will be soon :)

As you may have noticed, I've set up a git repo at

    
    git://git.compiz-fusion.org/users/smspillaz/0.6-ports


containing ports to Compiz-0.6 of all the new, popular and exciting unofficial development happening recently. I've just fixed the anaglyph plugin after some time spent investigating issues with BCOP (Rearranging option names - ex anaglyphOffsetDesktop -> anaglyphDesktopOffset ) :-|. I need some testers for that btw ;-)

Photo plugin and atlantis-2 should be fixed fairly shortly, I just need to figure out what is going on there...

I've also (re)written Compiz-Decorator-Settings to be a bit... better

Finally, I found out this way to take uber-sleek screenshot + not-so-great descriptions via Compiz

Yes that is rendered in real-time :D (Except for the text :D)

Coming soon to a tip-of-the-week near you!
