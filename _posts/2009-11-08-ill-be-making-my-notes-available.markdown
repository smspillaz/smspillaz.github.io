After the TEE (November 19th) if any student in WA finds them useful (although most of them will sadly be for outdated subjects that are no longer taught next year).

They will be in PDF format, Copyright to me but licensed under BY-CC-SA.

Subjects are:
TEE Applicable Mathematics,
TEE Physics,
TEE History,
TEE English Literature,
Media Production and Analysis 3AB
Computer Science 3AB.

You'll have to put up with my messy handwriting and drawings though, sorry.
