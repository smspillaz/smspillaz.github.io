My hands are colder now too.Â [I can find a little serendipity in nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir3eFSGtfiU), but I wish I hadn't disappeared the way I did. I have always seen and can see the past like a flood of storms around me. I wish I could reach out to it, but there's just so much water that its hard to know where to begin.

My soul is shivering in this rain. Be brave.
