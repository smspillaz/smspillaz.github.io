Another blog post!

Since the release the core team has been doing a bit of planning for what we want to do in the upcoming 0.9.2 release. A roadmap of "big features" will be coming in the next week or so.

In the meantime I've been trying my hand at porting some of the other non-official plugins. Work is going pretty well so far, we now have the following plugins done:



	
  * Dodge Windows

	
  * Dim Dialog

	
  * Simple Animations

	
  * Screensaver (ongoing work here too, stay tuned)

	
  * Anaglyph (thanks soreau)

	
  * Toggle Decoration (thanks soreau)

	
  * Freewins

	
  * Desktopclick

	
  * Mousetrails


There are still a few more unofficial plugins to go until we have 100% feature parity with the 0.8 branch. Among some of the ones I'm working on right now:

	
  * Animations Plus

	
  * Newton (Physics Engine for Compiz)

	
  * Sound (ALSA based sounds on window events)


We've also had some bugfixes, particularly to the animation plugin where animations wouldn't fire for some windows (thanks Jay!)

Otherwise, it looks like we'll be implementing *small* user requested features in the time being and continuing to fix bugs. It's all quite fun!
