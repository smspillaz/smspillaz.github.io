period: Nov 2010 - Nov 2012
desc: Canonical is the company that provides primary development and support services
      for [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com), the most widely used server and desktop
      Linux distribution worldwide.
my_role: I worked first in the Desktop Experience group and then in the
         Product Strategy group. I worked primarily on [Compiz](/projects/compiz)
         and [Unity](/projects/unity).
outcomes: My team and I successfuly delivered the first iteration of Unity
          running on top of Compiz for Ubuntu 11.04. We delivered three additional
          refinement releases in Ubuntu versions 11.10, 12.04 and 12.10. Part of
          the work I was involved with included tightly integrating the shell
          with the window manager, creating a 1000-test strong automated
          testing framework and working with the design-team to implement new
          features. We also worked with hardware vendors to enable the desktop
          experience on embedded platforms.
